# sentiment-analysis-covid-19

## About this project
This project was a final assignment for an Economics & Data Science module, completed in May 2021. It details the sentiment analysis, research and findings from my work at the time, focusing on the feelings of X (formerly known as Twitter) users towards the various COVID-19 vaccines, based on the content of their tweets. As an avid user of X (formerly known as Twitter), I'm aware of the wide variety of opinions on the platform, so this was an interesting project to complete. I consider this to be my first foray into natural language processing and my gentle introduction to using artificial intelligence to gain more information about users.

The only change made to the markdown file was the change in the 'author' field to use my full name instead of my university ID number. Everything else remains intact.

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle on April 9, 2021 - the dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/all-covid19-vaccines-tweets/version/52
